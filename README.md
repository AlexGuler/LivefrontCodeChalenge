## Livefront Code Challenge

This project is the code challenge for Livefront

This app uses the Omdb API to search for Movies, Series, Episodes & Games.

It also has pagination. When you search for anything there is a `debounce` for 1 second to allow the user to
complete their search.

Tapping on any of the movies, series, episodes or games will bring up a detail view of that item.
